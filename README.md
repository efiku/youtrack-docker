# youtrack-docker

This project includes full working setup for using Youtrack as standalone version.

I chose docker-compose option so, very much tahnks to **Jetbrains** for the HUB ;)
My option includes full config of nginx site setup and properly setup for docker as docker-compose.

Make sure to run file `before.sh` to prepare permissions.
